# Professional Resume Website

This is a clean, modern, and responsive resume website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It showcases your skills, experience, education, and projects in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects and smooth transitions provide an engaging user experience.

- **Clear Sectioning:**  Content is divided into well-defined sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Education, Experience, Contact) for easy navigation.

- **Contact Form:** A functional contact form allows visitors to reach out directly from the website. (Note: This requires server-side setup for actual email sending).

- **Downloadable CV:** Includes a prominent button to download your resume in PDF format. (You'll need to provide the path to your PDF file).

- **Visually Appealing:** The design uses a professional color palette, modern fonts, and subtle animations to create a positive impression.

## HTML Structure

- The website is structured using semantic HTML5 elements for better SEO and accessibility:
    - `<header>`: Contains the navigation and introductory content.
    - `<main>`:  Holds the primary content of the website (skills, projects, etc.).
    - `<section>`: Divides the content into logical sections.
    - `<article>`: Encapsulates independent pieces of content, like project descriptions.
    - `<footer>`: Contains copyright information and potentially other relevant links.

- Bootstrap's grid system (`<div class="row">` and `<div class="col-md-*">`) is used to create the layout.

## CSS Styling

- **styles.css:** This file contains all the custom CSS rules.
- **Key CSS Features Used:**
    - **Flexbox:** For flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the header and project cards.
    - **Grid:** Used to create the visually appealing skill grid.
    - **Transitions:** Provide smooth hover effects on buttons and other elements.
    - **Media Queries:**  Apply different styles based on screen size to ensure responsiveness. 
    - **Custom Colors and Fonts:**  A blue color scheme and clean fonts create a professional aesthetic.

- **index.html:** The main HTML file for the resume website.
- **styles.css:** The stylesheet containing all the CSS rules.
